# Getting Started 

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

If I had more time I would have 
- displayed more of the data availible on the api 
- made a column selector to customize which data was shown
- made it prettier
- consolodated how information was being saved in the state, cause it's a little wet atm
